    <blockquote><p>This house was built in the astonishing 1890s, At this time it can truly 
        be said this was when the American architecture began to showcase how beautiful our 
        land can be. At this time many other grand mansions were built to brighten up the land,
        but no other house could do it just like Walker Lane. The multitude of mansions was 
        also built to flatter the egos of “robber barons”. But many have agreed, none of them 
        enticed them like this house does.
    </p>
    <br><br>
        <p>
        The possibilities are endless with this house. The changes and improvements 
        show that this house is built to stay, and you can too! Living by a creekside 
        has never been more viable with this home. It has three beds to accommodate a 
        whole family and two full bathrooms. Along with that, there are multiple living 
        quarters for the guests that will be envious of this New England Shingle Style and 
        County rustic along with the luxurious Gothic-styled tower! All of this together 
        truly makes a beautiful living space.
